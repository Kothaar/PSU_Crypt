# CS465 Project 2 - PDX_PubCrypt.py

## Usage
**This is a toy asymmetric public-key cryptosystem. Don't use for any serious cryptography!!!**
  
PDX_PubCrypt is implimented with python3 and  runs with either command line flags 
or with user input after being prompted.  
  
  
### Command Line Flags  
These flags can be entered from the command line example: `./PDX_PubCrypt.py -f`
If a flag isn't entered when the script is executed it will prompt the user for input.    
  
| Flag |User Input| Description|  
|------|---|-------------|
|-g|g| Key generation|  
|-e|e| Encryption|  
|-d|d| Decryption|  
|-f|f| Generate a new key, encrypt, then decrypt|
  
  
Anything else will result in a 'Bad Input!' error and the program will exit.  
  
  
## Files
  
The only required files to run the first time are `PDX_PubCrypt.py` and `ptext.txt` just make sure to generate keys first.
  
| Files | Description| Required or Generated |
|------|-------------|-----------------------|
|PDX_PubCrypt.py|Main program script, run this to run the program|  Can't really do anything without this |
|ptext.txt| Where the plaintext that you want encrypted goes|  Required for encryption, you should make this |
|dtext.txt| Decrypted plaintext, hopefully it matches ptext.txt| Generated by decryption hopefully matches ptext.txt |
|ctext.txt| Encrypted plaintext organized in m<sub>n</sub> c<sub>1</sub> c<sub>2</sub>| Generated by encryption, required for decryption |
|prikey.txt| Private key file. organized in: p g d | Generated by Keygen required for encryption/decryption |
|pubkey.txt| public key file organized in: p g e<sub>2</sub>| Generated by Keygen required for encryption/decryption |
